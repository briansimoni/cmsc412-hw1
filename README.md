# CMSC 412 HW1

## Compile/Usage Instructions

You will need to have [Go](https://golang.org) installed to compile from source code.
Once you have Go installed, you can:

`go build`
and then
`./cmsc412-hw1`

It will try to read in graph.txt from the present working directory and output wdegree.txt in the same directory.

Here is the link to download Go
[https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install)

If you don't feel like downloading, installing, and configuring Go, I've compiled it for the major operating systems and I have them availble for download on my website.

You may need to `sudo chmod 500 cmsc412-hw1` to get execute permissions
